The model uses chemical characteristics of wine to predict its quality (0–10 scale).
Steps performed include:

✔ 1. Data Understanding

Checking missing values, distribution, and correlations.

✔ 2. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Removing outliers

Scaling features (if needed)

✔ 3. Model Training

The Random Forest Classifier was trained on the processed dataset.

✔ 4. Evaluation

The model achieved 70% accuracy, along with detailed metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report.
